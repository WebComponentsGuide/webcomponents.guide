title: What are Web Components?
---
Web Components are a native way for web developers to define UI in a [[Component model]]. It's built right into your browser so you don't have to download any framework to get started!

Web Components allow you to define custom element tags for HTML and define it's behavior and look. You might be familar with existing HTML tags such as `<button>` and `<details>`. Custom Elements defined by developers might be `<big-button>` or `<details-menu>` which have definitions that are made up by the developers that wrote those elements and not defined by the browser vendor.

=Note: Custom Element tag names are required to include a dash in it's name. It's a low-tech way to allow browsers and users to tell if a tag name is a custom or native element=

Web Components build on top of existing web standards such as [[Events]], [[DOM]] and [[CSS]].

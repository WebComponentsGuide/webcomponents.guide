These docs will assume you've used JavaScript before, and are familiar with how it works. This section has some brief
guides on some of the more important (and perhaps newer) pieces of JavaScript you'll need to know in order to be
productive with Web Components.

If you're new to JavaScript or haven't used JavaScript for a long time, it's worth reading through [MDN's Introduction
to JavaScript][mdn-intro] and [MDN's JavaScript Language Overview][mdn-overview]. It'll cover concepts that this guide
won't go into.

### What are Web Components?

The term "Web Components" encompasses a lot of individual APIs, some that have existed for a very long time in the web,
and some that are much newer. If you've written JavaScript before then you might be familiar with [Classes][classes], If
you've written JavaScript for the _web_ before, you might already be familar with some of _those_ APIs too, for example
[Events][events] and the [DOM APIs][dom-apis] like `querySelector`. Many Web Components will make use of those existing
APIs.

Web Components go further to add a powerful set of additional APIs. One of those is [Custom
Elements][defining-a-component] which allows you to define your own HTML Elements. Web Components can also make use of
the [ShadowDOM][shadowdom] which is a powerful API that allows you to manage how an element is rendered.

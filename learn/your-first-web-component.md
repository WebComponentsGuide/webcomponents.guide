title: Your First Web Component

The term _Web Components_ encompasses a lot of individual APIs, some that have existed for a very long time in the web,
and some that are much newer. If you've written JavaScript before then you might be familiar with [Classes][classes], If
you've written JavaScript for the web before, you might already be familiar with some of those APIs too, for example
[Events][events] and the [DOM APIs][dom-apis] like `querySelector`. Many Web Components will make use of those existing
APIs.

_Web Components_ go further to add a powerful set of additional APIs. One of those is [_Custom
Elements_][defining-a-component] which allows you to define your own HTML Elements. _Web Components_ can also make use
of [_ShadowDOM_][shadowdom] which is a powerful API that allows you to manage how an element is rendered.

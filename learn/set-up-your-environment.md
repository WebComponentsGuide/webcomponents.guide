## IDE
At the time of writing, VSCode is one of the more popular editors to write code in and with good reason! It comes with exelent support for writing HTML, JavaScript and CSS out of the box as well as some great plugins that you can install. This makes it ideal for writing Web Components and websites that use them.

You can download and learn more about VSCode on https://code.visualstudio.com/.

No worries if you're not using VSCode since it's not strictly neccesary but we reccomend it to newcomers.

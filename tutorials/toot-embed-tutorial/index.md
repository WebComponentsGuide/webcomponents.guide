Welcome to this tutorial on building a Mastodon toot embed element using Web Components! In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of creating a custom element that can be used to easily display Mastodon toots on any website or application.

Our Mastodon toot embed element will allow users to share and display toots from the Mastodon social network, and will include features such as the ability to show or hide the user handle and avatar image, as well as the option to customize the appearance of the toot.

Here's a example of a Mastodon toot embed. We'll be making something similar.

<iframe src="https://fosstodon.org/@koddsson/109535622423696807/embed" class="mastodon-embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="400" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><script src="https://fosstodon.org/embed.js" async="async"></script>

We will start by setting up the project files and dependencies, and then move on to defining the Mastodon toot embed element class, extending the HTMLElement class, and registering the element with the browser. We will also cover adding properties and methods to the element, using a shadow DOM for improved styling and separation of concerns, and adding interactivity to the element.

Finally, we will look at integrating the Mastodon toot embed element with a real-world project, including tips for building and using the element in a production environment.

Throughout this tutorial, we will explore the various features and capabilities of Web Components, and how they can be used to build reusable and modular components for the web.

So let's get started!
